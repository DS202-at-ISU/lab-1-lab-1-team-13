# Lab report #1

#Section 12.1 
So, 
- We all made our githubs accounts and forked the team repository in our githubs accounts using the github classroom link shared on canvas announcements. 
- We verified our installation of R and RStudio on our personal devices.
- We installed Git by using the terminal commands `git --version` and installed git using the mac Xcode using the GUI command line tools.
- We then declared our names and emails to github using the following commands:
  - `git config --global user.name {your name}`
  - `git config --global user.email {email}`

#Section 12.2
- We made our own personal testing repositories to test the push and pull commands.
- Creating a repo:
 - Using the github GUI we created our own public repo's and named them as MyRepo and had these repo's made out of no templates and default README.md files.
